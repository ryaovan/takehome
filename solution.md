* What's the command to start the application locally? (default is `npm start`)

* What part are you most proud of and why?
* Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

# Other
* Anything else you'd like us to know (about your implementation or otherwise)?
* How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
